Ruleby :: The Rule Engine for Ruby
==================================

Description

Ruleby is a rule engine written in the Ruby language. It is a system for executing a set

the forward chaining Rete algorithm. Ruleby provides an internal Domain Specific Language 
(DSL) for building the productions that make up a Ruleby program.
